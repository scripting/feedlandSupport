This is a bit of code that runs outside of the FeedLand app that reads an OPML subscription list of NYT feeds, and gets a river in JSON for that list of feeds.

From there, you can experiment, by coming up with your own subscription list, and writing code that renders the river. 

I will release a package for displaying these rivers both as standalones and as a set of tabs, for multiple rivers. 

This goes beyond feed readers, it's publishing flows from many feeds, without requiring the reader to do anything but read. 

I've started a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/feedlandSupport/issues/13#issuecomment-1204155566">thread</a> for questions/comments and if you want to show off anything you've done with it. Almost anything would be impressive at this very early stage. :-)
