# FeedLand Support

FeedLand is a place to share and discover feeds. 

### Private site

This is a private site, but when the product is ready, it'll become public.

So whatever you read here for now must stay within the community, later it'll all be open for anyone to read. So keep this in mind as you write here. 

You might want to watch the site, so you are notified via email of updates.

### Overview of product

I wrote a quick <a href="https://github.com/scripting/feedlandSupport/blob/main/docs/overview.md">overview</a>, not meant as a tutorial, to give you an idea of the scope of the product. 

### There's been a delay

It's a long story. I was planning on opening the initial testing on July 23 but we hit a snag with a system we use, we could work around but but instead, I'm going to be patient and wait. 

At this point I expect to open FeedLand up for initial testing early-mid the week of July 25.
