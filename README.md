# FeedLand Support

FeedLand is a <a href="http://feedland.org/">place</a> to share and discover feeds. 

### Private site

This is a private site, but when the product is ready to go, it'll become public.

So whatever you read here for now must stay within the community, later it'll all be open for anyone to read. So keep this in mind as you write here. 

You might want to watch the site, so you are notified via email of updates.

### Overview of product

I wrote a quick overview, not meant as a tutorial, to give you an idea of the scope of the product. 

### There's been a delay

It's a long story, but Twitter's software is not happy about one of the domains we're using. As far as I know, there's nothing wrong with it, and they're being <i>very</i> helpful. I was planning on opening the initial testing on July 23. I could work around the problem, but for now, I'm going to be patient and wait. 

At this point I expect to open FL up for initial testing early-mid the week of July 25.
