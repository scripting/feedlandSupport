# Greetings from FeedLand

<i>This is the first email I am sending to testers of the initial release of the product. DW</i>

Good evening everyone! ;-)

A while back I asked if you were interested in helping get the bugs out of a new product. 

So I just wanted to check in, and make sure this email address works and give you a rough idea how this will work.

Now I'm going to throw a bunch of facts at you. This is not meant to be a tutorial, rather to give you an overview of this new platform called FeedLand.

### Community

First it's a community project. 

In the community there are feeds and people. 

People subscribe to feeds. 

People can add new feeds. For now there's a limit of 100 new feeds each user gets to add.  

* So go slow and carefully, don't just dump your entire 8-year OPML subscription list in the database.

You can also subscribe to feeds other people have added. There's no limit there. Subscribe to as many as you like.

### Feeds and feed lists

All the feeds you've subscribed to will appear on your feed list, in reverse chronological order of when they were updated. 

You get to your feed list by choosing the first command in the menu, which is named <i>Menu.</i>

A feed is "Updated" when a new item has appeared, although we do recognize other kinds of updates, and sync them up with the database. Items can change over time. But a feed only changes when there's a new item.

I am starting to add feeds, before you have access to the database, by subscribing to a bunch of feeds. 

I've started out by subscribing to about 20 feeds, more or less. At first I thought they would be exemplary feeds, but right now who knows what that means. So consider them roughly random.

You can see the feeds I've subscribed to. And by clicking on a checkbox next to a feed, you can subscribe to it too. Or you can click on the Info link to find out who else is subscribed to the feed, and see what they're subscribed to too. 

You get to find new feeds and people this way. 

If you've used <a href="http://bingeworthy.io/">BingeWorthy</a>, it works the same way, only here it's feeds and there it's TV shows. And people. In both cases it involves people. 

### Where this goes

I don't know where this goes. In a real way that'll be up to the users -- ie you, to start. So I'll be watching and listening, to get ideas. 

I want to go slow and learn a lot as we go. I've been doing that all through this project. I want to, this once, get it right. Really advance the art in how we use feeds. To take what we know now in 2022, that we didn't know last time we really dug into this stuff (in my case that was a pretty long time ago). 

### Back up your work!

I will say this part many times: Back up your work! There's a big orange XML icon on your feedlist page. When you click it you'll get an OPML subscription list. Save the file locally, periodically. You never know when the database will be reset. This is very early, so who knows what kinds of problems will come up. 

* You can also get an OPML subscription list when you're looking at someone else's subscriptions. 

* It's a community. That was the first thing I said in this email. It's all about community.

Anyway.. I'm just scratching the surface. If you're still up for this adventure, with other really kickass people, stick around. Or if you feel you won't have the time, let me know and I'll take you off the list.

BTW, so you know -- there will be at most one email a day. There might be multiple items, but that's all the mailbox attention FeedLand is asking for. 

And one other thing, please don't share this with other people. I want to build slowly and carefully. I asked you to be part of it because you're smart and thoughtful and care. Not everyone is like that.  

Dave
