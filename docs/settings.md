# Settings

The Settings command in the System menu opens a tabbed dialog box with settings. The System menu is in the top right corner of the screen.

### Categories

You can set the categories for all feeds, or the categories that are displayed on your news page, and the categories for your news product.

### News products

The settings on this page are explained in the docs for News products.  

### Linker

The third panel makes it possible to set the URL of the app you use for linkblogging. 

When you click the RT icon below each item in a timeline, it opens the Feed editor page, with the title, link and description filled in the edit box.

If you use a different tool for linkblogging you can enter its URL in this panel. Any software used for that will hopefully tell you how to set this up.   

### Misc

This panel allows you to change some random settings.

<i>* News is the home page. </i>If you check this box, when you go to feedland.org you will be taken to your News page. If you uncheck it, you'll go to your Feed List page. Default is unchecked.

<i>* Show news items in a small box at the top of the screen. </i>If checked, you will get a box through which news scrolls, one story at a time, in realtime. Default is unchecked. <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2022/10/20/newsbox.png">Screen shot</a>.
