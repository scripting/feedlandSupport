# FeedLand Docs

The docs are being updated here, bringing them current, and using them to review the functionality of the product looking for things that need attention. 

This is where we work on the docs, so if you spot problems you can open an issue. Problems can be outright mistakes, things that weren't clear, questions the docs raise but don't answer. 

The actual site that users will see is:  <a href="http://docs2.feedland.org/">docs2.feedland.org</a>. The text of that site comes from this repository.
